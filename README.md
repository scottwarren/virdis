## References

I had no experience building games, so I read up on details that I was unsure about

1. https://medium.com/projector-hq/writing-a-run-loop-in-javascript-react-9605f74174b
1. https://indepthjavascript.dev/how-to-create-a-simple-game-loop-in-react-javascripttypescript-in-under-10-lines-of-code

## Areas of focus

While building this, I wanted to focus on some areas to either learn about or brush up on my skills:

1. Game loop (in general, but more specifically, how to implement one in React)
1. React Context.
1. How to structure a project that is not a simple CRUD app.
1. Canvas :) -- I originally built this using divs which with hindsight is a bit silly, but it now uses Canvas.

## Local Dev

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
